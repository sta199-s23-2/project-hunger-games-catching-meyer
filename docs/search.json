    "text": "This project aims to determine what factors impact Alexandra Trusova’s jump performance in ice skating competitions. We sourced data from the International Skating Union’s databases and individual countrys’ skating association websites and conducted hypothesis tests to evaluate whether changes in altitude, competition distance from Moscow, and the difficulty of the jump respectively impacted Trusova’s jump performance. We also created predictive models and visualizations to support our results. We conclude that no singular factor has a significant impact on Trusova’s jump performance. Although our conclusions cannot be generalized to the sport as a whole until it can be supported by data gathered from the careers of other skaters, our results speak to Trusova’s high level of training and how even Olympic-level figure skaters can fall and mess up periodically with no particular pattern. Additionally, our results indicate that additional data of varying types, as well as more skater-specific sensitive information like body weight, injury status, and mental health, should be collected to allow for future research regarding patterns in the quality of a jumping pass’s execution."

    "text": "Introduction and data\n\nIdentify the source of the data: The data is from the competition records of the International Skating Union, Tallinn Trophy, and the Russian Skating Federation. The International Skating Union (ISU) is the governing body of figure skating competition around the world. ISU-sanctioned and many other competitions have websites containing records of the detailed results of the competition. (There is a separate site for each competition so for brevity’s sake sites will not be linked here.)\nState when and how it was originally collected: The ISU keeps records of the detailed score breakdowns, known as protocols, for each skater at each of its competitions. Each country’s skating federation also keeps these records for their domestic competitions, including national championships. Each competition has its own individual webpage, on which pdfs containing these protocols can be found. Everything is included, from jumps to spins to artistry scores. As the collector of the data file, I selected the competitions attended by Alexandra Trusova and pulled the data for each of her jumping passes into a .csv file. There are no ethical questions with this dataset due to its quantitative nature, drawing only from the judging protocols.\nWrite a brief description of the observations: There is an entry for each jumping pass attempted by Trusova in either ISU-sanctioned international competition, another international competition, or at a Russian National Championship. The data accompanying it include the data the jumping pass was attempted, the competition season it occurred, the location of the competition, and other data such as whether the jumping pass was a solo jump or a combination, any technical calls issued, and the grade of execution received.\nAll of this information is available publicly so there is no ethical/privacy concerns about the data.\nWe are in the process of adding more observations to the dataset, and there will be 303 once the process is complete."

    "text": "Research question\n\nFor this data set, our research question is as follows: How did Alexandra Trusova’s jumping passes evolve over time, and how do different factors affect her successful execution of difficult technical content?\nOur research question is important because it investigates many of the trends figure skating fans believe to exist with Russian figure skaters – namely, the “expiration date” that occurs once a skater reaches 16 or 17. It will also allow us to explore other trends that occur with an athlete that executed jumps never before done by female skaters and track Trusova’s progress over her entire career.\nDescription of the research topic: Alexandra Trusova is a notable Russian figure skater. She has spent 5 seasons competing internationally for Russia at various ISU-sanctioned competitions including the Grand Prix circuit, European championships, World championships, and even the Olympics. She has pushed the technical boundaries of the sport, and her development over the years is interesting to track. In her novice years, she struggled to land clean triple jumps. By her junior years, she was attempting quadruple jumps. By her senior years, she was attempting multiple quadruple jumps in each program, often in combination.\nIndividual skaters may have preferences for competition location, such as those close to home. They may also be better at jumps attempted in the first half of a competition as compared to the second half. Their success rate at a particular jumping pass may change over the seasons. It’s also possible that as a skater introduces a new jumping pass into their program, their success rate for other jumps will be affected. We hypothesize that there will be strong correlations between jump number and level and the successful outcome of a jumping pass.\nThere are both categorical and quantitative variables in this dataset. The variables which describe the competition and the basic jump info are categorical, and the variables describing the point value of the jump (jump_bv, goe_raw, goe_scaled, point_value, and other numerical values) are quantitative."

Landing for success: a biomechanical and perceptual analysis of on-ice jumps in figure skating. Sports Biomech. 2006 Jul;5(2):231-41. doi: 10.1080/14763140608522876. PMID: 16939155.\nThe study in the article investigated the biomechanical variables affecting the technical success of a jump. The researchers attached markers to anatomical points on the skater’s body, filmed the jump, and conducted analysis in two ways: objectively using biomechanical measures and subjectively by accredited figure skating judges. They found that the correlation between “biomechanical landing strategies” and judge perception is strong enough to support the continuation of the current subjective judging methods in figure skating.\nOur research is different than the article cited because it looks at other non-biomechanical factors affecting the outcome of a jump, such as altitude, location, time of year, segment of competition, and position in program. Additionally our data focuses on a single skater rather than multiple. Of course this means our findings cannot be extrapolated to other skaters, but it will find out what factors specifically influence Alexandra Trusova’s technical success in her programs."

To determine patient outcomes, we want to look at the number of weekly deaths, the number of hospital admissions, the percentage of staffed adult inpatient beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the percentage of staffed adult ICU beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients. We chose to look at Los Angeles and San Diego as they both have diverse populations (in terms of both ethnicity socioeconomic status), but of different sizes. We thus plan on observing trends both (1) across Los Angeles and San Diego and (2) within the respective counties and examining whether there are differences between the two. This question is important because the results can be used as evidence to advocate for (1) additional research to be done in how to improve COVID-19 tests and for (2) additional funding to make tests more widely available across both the United States and globally.\nOur hypothesis is that increased testing improves patient outcomes. We predict this because an early diagnosis should allow an individual to receive treatment (e.x. paxlovid) earlier and prevents the spreading of COVID to populations who are at high risk of mortality.\nThe variables we will look at include:\n\nWeekly Cases – Quantitative\nWeekly Deaths – Quantitative\nTests performed (7 day rolling average) – Quantitative\nNew Admissions Confirmed COVID-19 per 100000 Population Last 7 Days – Quantitative\nPercentage of staffed adult inpatient beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients over a trailing 7 day period – Quantitative\nPercentage of staffed adult ICU beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients over a trailing 7 day period - Quantitative\nCounty – Categorical (Los Angeles County or San Diego County)"

The article finds that though testing frequency was similar to the rest of the world, average incidence and mortality rates per population were 70% and 90% lower, respectively. It also unexpectedly found that higher-testing Gulf Cooperation Council countries saw similar case-fatality rates as other Eastern Mediterranean countries which was higher than the world average. The article suggests further studies in demographic and genetic factors should be examined to better understand patient outcomes per test frequency. \nOur research question similarly examines the relationship between testing frequency and patient outcomes (including fatality rates), but within Los Angeles and San Diego counties.

This analysis attempts to determine whether a correlation exists between the party alignment of circuit court panel judges and the Supreme Court’s rate of overturning circuit court decisions.

The data analyzed is from the years 1995-2004 and covers cases from 16 different issue types. After analysis, the author finds that decisions by circuit courts with 3 Democrat judges were four times as likely to be chosen for review and overturned by the Supreme Court than decisions by circuit courts with 3 Republican judges. \nThis article is similar to the work we are doing, as it attempts to connect factors of a case to partisanship in order to highlight predictors of Supreme Court partisanship and the existence of the Supreme Court as a partisan body.

    "title": "Impact of Select Variables on Trusova’s Jump Execution",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Methodology\nWe answered our research question using hypothesis testing and modeling. We conducted hypothesis tests to determine whether differences in the execution score of the jump are influenced by certain variables. This was done by comparing mean execution scores for certain predictor variable groups. We utilized bootstrapping methods instead of the central limit theorem because we cannot prove independence, since all of the jumps are done by the same individual. We also cannot conclude that this was a random sample of Trusova’s jumps since we specifically selected for national championships and international competitions when creating the dataset.\nWe also created linear regression models and calculated their adjusted R^2 and AIC. We used the adjusted R^2 and AIC as benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of our three variables at predicting Trusova’s jump execution as they respectively penalize the addition of bad variables and penalize models with more variables. We chose to use additive models because the variables we decided to test do not interact with each other and thus cannot impact one another. Because there are only three factors, we created models of every possible combination of variables, so a stepwise model selection process was not necessary. \n\nHypothesis Testing\nJump Difficulty\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  jump_group mean_goe_raw     n\n  <chr>             <dbl> <int>\n1 easy_jumps         1.56   146\n2 hard_jumps         1.21   147\n\n\n\\(\\bar{x_e}\\) - \\(\\bar{x_h}\\) = 0.356138\n\\(H_o:\\) \\(\\mu_e - \\mu_h\\) = 0\n\\(H_a:\\) \\(\\mu_e - \\mu_h\\) \\(>\\) 0\n\nNull: The difficulty of the jump has no significant effect on the execution of the jump.\nAlternate: As the difficulty of the jump increases, the execution of the jump, as defined by the raw goe, decreases.\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = goe_raw ~ jump_bv, data = jump_difficulty)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-6.4407 -0.4173  1.2693  1.8441  3.1178 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This means that at a 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that an increase in the difficulty score of a jump lowers Trusova’s execution of that jump.\nAltitude\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  alt_group     mean_goe_raw     n\n  <chr>                <dbl> <int>\n1 high_altitude         1.69   147\n2 low_altitude          1.08   146\n\n\n\\(\\bar{x_h}\\) - \\(\\bar{x_l}\\) = 0.605648\n\\(H_o:\\) \\(\\mu_h - \\mu_l\\) = 0\n\\(H_a:\\) \\(\\mu_h - \\mu_l\\) \\(\\neq\\) 0\n\nNull: The altitude of the competition location has no significant effect on the execution of the jump.\nAlternate: The altitude of the competition location (whether it is low or high) affects the execution of the jump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that the true mean goe_raw score for low altitude competitions is equal to the true mean goe_raw score for high altitude competitions, the probability that we observe a sample mean difference of 0.605648 or something more extreme is about ~ 0.056.\nGiven that our significance level 0.05 < p-value 0.056, we conclude there is insufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis / weak evidence to conclude the alternative hypothesis.

This means that at a 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the execution of the jump, as defined by the raw goe, decreases as the distance between Moscow and the competition location increases.\n\n\nPredictive Models\nThe adjusted R squared and AIC values (in that order) are below. The models respectively take into account: (1) difficulty, (2) altitude, (3) distance, (4) altitude and difficulty, (5) distance and difficulty, (6) altitude and distance, (7) altitude, distance, and difficulty.\n\n\n[1] -0.003212615\n\n\n[1] 1452.262\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.04228525\n\n\n[1] 1438.663\n\n\n\n\n[1] -0.0003385914\n\n\n[1] 1451.421\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.03911718\n\n\n[1] 1440.622\n\n\n\n\n[1] -0.003458247\n\n\n[1] 1453.325\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.04217186\n\n\n[1] 1439.689\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.03907736\n\n\n[1] 1441.622\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThe results from our hypothesis tests are as follows:\nWe failed to reject our null hypotheses for all of the hypothesis tests. The test that was closest to rejecting our null hypothesis at a significance level of 5% was the test that looked at the execution score by the altitude of competitions, followed closely by the test that looked at the execution score by the difficulty of jumps. However, all of the tests failed to provide sufficient evidence that the difficulty of the jump or the location of the competitions has a significant effect on Trusova’s execution of her jumps.\nThese results make sense because it is likely that professional skaters such as Trusova try to mitigate the effect of variables such as distance and altitude on their execution scores. Professional skaters likely (1) travel way in advance of competitions to ensure that they are not jet-lagged and (2) practice difficult jumps more often than easy ones.\nThese results could also be explained by the process in which we split the sample set by the median to create the top and bottom groups for the difference in mean goe_raw scores in each instance. If we were to conduct further hypothesis testing, we could adjust the ways we created the “high” and “low” groups, perhaps changing to above or below a mean value. It would also be better to have a larger sample set from other skaters and more compeititons from which to draw conclusions.\nThe results from our predictive models are as follows:\nThe adjusted R squared values were less than 0.05 for all of the models. The model that predicted Trusova’s raw score using only the altitude of the competition location had the highest adjusted R squared value of 0.04228525. This value, however, is still low, which indicates that none of these regression models are good fits.\nThe AIC values were above 1400 for all of the models, which indicates that none of the models are good fits. The model that predicted Trusova’s raw score using only the altitude of the competition location had the lowest AIC value of 1438.663. \nThe adjusted R squared and AIC values thus both indicate that the altitude_model is the best at predicting Trusova’s raw score. However, this model is still not a good fit. There are two possibilities here: (1) that we are looking at incorrect variables, and (2) that there is no singular factor that plays a large role in a skater’s performance, with critics’ claims regarding jump consistency and overall execution being unfounded.\n\n\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate that no singular observed factor has a significant impact on Trusova’s jump performance. We failed to reject our null hypothesis in all of our hypothesis tests, and all 7 of our predictive models had AIC values above 1430 and adjusted R squared values below 0.05.\nOur data is valid as it is gathered from official competition data from the International Skating Union and individual countries’ skating federations. However, it is not necessarily reliable because: 1) There is a small amount of bias and variability inherent in figure skating judging as a result of vague GOE guidelines. 2) The data focuses on one skater’s performances at national championships and international competitions, and this small sample size allows for variability in patterns in the data. There are also only a handful of female skaters who have performed numerous types of quads, so it was not possible to gather data for a large sample of skaters. Additionally, it was not feasible to include data from more jumpers within the time frame of the project.\nAs such, the conclusions we’ve drawn regarding Alexandra Trusova’s jumps and performance cannot be generalized to the sport of figure skating as a whole until it can be supported by data gathered from the careers of other skaters. This is mainly the result of our methods, and we could improve our analysis by gathering the same information for more female skaters that have performed quadruple jumps over their entire careers. In future research, additional data of varying types, including skater-specific sensitive information, should be collected to find other potential predictors of jump outcome via hypothesis testing. It may be helpful to collect this information from a cohort of skaters over a duration of several seasons.\nWhile we cannot generalize the analysis we’ve done of one of the most talented figure skaters in the world to every other skater, there are a few key takeaways specific to Alexandra Trusova herself. It is notable that no variables appear to be able to predict the execution of Trusova’s jumps, which are of similar quality every time. This speaks to both her high level of training and how even Olympic-level figure skaters mess up periodically with no particular pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChapman, Robert F., Jonathon L.
