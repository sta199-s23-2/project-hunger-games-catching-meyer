    "text": "Introduction and data\n\nThe data is from the competition records of the International Skating Union, Tallinn Trophy, and the Russian Skating Federation. The International Skating Union (ISU) is the governing body of figure skating competition around the world. ISU-sanctioned and many other competitions have websites containing records of the detailed results of the competition. (There is a separate site for each competition so for brevity’s sake sites will not be linked here.)\nThe ISU keeps records of the detailed score breakdowns, known as protocols, for each skater at each of its competitions. Each country’s skating federation also keeps these records for their domestic competitions, including national championships. Each competition has its own individual webpage, on which pdfs containing these protocols can be found. Everything is included, from jumps to spins to artistry scores. As the collector of the data file, I selected the competitions attended by Alexandra Trusova and pulled the data for each of her jumping passes into a .csv file.\nThere is an entry for each jumping pass attempted by Trusova in either ISU-sanctioned international competition, another international competition, or at a Russian National Championship. The data accompanying it include the data the jumping pass was attempted, the competition season it occurred, the location of the competition, and other data such as whether the jumping pass was a solo jump or a combination, any technical calls issued, and the grade of execution received.\nWe are in the process of adding more observations to the dataset, and there will be around 300 once the process is complete."

    "text": "Research question\n\nHow did Alexandra Trusova’s jumping passes evolve over time, and how do different factors affect her successful execution of difficult technical content?\nAlexandra Trusova is a notable Russian figure skater. She has spent 5 seasons competing internationally for Russia at various ISU-sanctioned competitions including the Grand Prix circuit, European championships, World championships, and even the Olympics. She has pushed the technical boundaries of the sport, and her development over the years is interesting to track. In her novice years, she struggled to land clean triple jumps. By her junior years, she was attempting quadruple jumps. By her senior years, she was attempting multiple quadruple jumps in each program, often in combination.\nIndividual skaters may have preferences for competition location, such as those close to home. They may also be better at jumps attempted in the first half of a competition as compared to the second half. Their success rate at a particular jumping pass may change over the seasons. It’s also possible that as a skater introduces a new jumping pass into their program, their success rate for other jumps will be affected. We hypothesize that there will be strong correlations between jump number and level and the successful outcome of a jumping pass.\nThere are both categorical and quantitative variables in this dataset. The variables jump_bv, goe, and point_value are quantitative, and the remaining variables, which describe the competition and the basic jump info are categorical, and the variables describing the point value of the jump (jump_bv, goe, point_value are quantitative."

Landing for success: a biomechanical and perceptual analysis of on-ice jumps in figure skating. Sports Biomech. 2006 Jul;5(2):231-41. doi: 10.1080/14763140608522876. PMID: 16939155.\nThe study in the article investigated the biomechanical variables affecting the technical success of a jump. The researchers attached markers to anatomical points on the skater’s body, filmed the jump, and conducted analysis in two ways: objectively using biomechanical measures and subjectively by accredited figure skating judges. They found that the correlation between “biomechanical landing strategies” and judge perception is strong enough to support the continuation of the current subjective judging methods in figure skating.\nOur research is different than the article cited because it looks at other non-biomechanical factors affecting the outcome of a jump, such as altitude, location, time of year, segment of competition, and position in program. Additionally our data focuses on a single skater rather than multiple. Of course this means our findings cannot be extrapolated to other skaters, but it will find out what factors specifically influence Alexandra Trusova’s technical success in her programs."

The hospital & testing data was reported by hospitals/clinics directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or via a state submission for collection in the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System.\nEach observation represents data from either Los Angeles or San Diego county during a 7-day period. The end date of that period is specified under the Date column, and the county is specified in the County column. The relevant data included for each entry are the number of cases, deaths, average tests performed, positivity rate, number of hospitalizations, percentage of staffed adult inpatient beds used by COVID-19 patients, and percentage of staffed adult ICU beds used by COVID-19 patients for that time period.\nThere are no ethical concerns about the data as it contains no information about specific patients, but rather data about a whole county across 7-day periods. We attempted to find datasets with information about individual patients, but none were accessible without IRB approval (likely due to HIPAA regulations)."

    "text": "Research question\n\nDoes increased COVID testing improve COVID-19 outcomes, specifically in Los Angeles, California and San Diego, California?\nWe want to research whether patient outcomes were better when increased testing occurred. To determine patient outcomes, we want to look at the number of weekly deaths, the number of hospital admissions, the percentage of staffed adult inpatient beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the percentage of staffed adult ICU beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients. We chose to look at Los Angeles and San Diego as they both have diverse populations (in terms of both ethnicity socioeconomic status), but of different sizes. We thus plan on observing trends both (1) across Los Angeles and San Diego and (2) within the respective counties and examining whether there are differences between the two. This question is important because the results can be used as evidence to advocate for (1) additional research to be done in how to improve COVID-19 tests and for (2) additional funding to make tests more widely available across both the United States and globally.\nOur hypothesis is that increased testing improves patient outcomes. We predict this because an early diagnosis should allow an individual to receive treatment (e.x. paxlovid) earlier and prevents the spreading of COVID to populations who are at high risk of mortality.\nThe variables we will look at include:\n\nWeekly Cases – Quantitative\nWeekly Deaths – Quantitative\nTests performed (7 day rolling average) – Quantitative\nNew Admissions Confirmed COVID-19 per 100000 Population Last 7 Days – Quantitative\nPercentage of staffed adult inpatient beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients over a trailing 7 day period – Quantitative\nPercentage of staffed adult ICU beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients over a trailing 7 day period - Quantitative\nCounty – Categorical (Los Angeles County or San Diego County)"

The article finds that though testing frequency was similar to the rest of the world, average incidence and mortality rates per population were 70% and 90% lower, respectively. It also unexpectedly found that higher-testing Gulf Cooperation Council countries saw similar case-fatality rates as other Eastern Mediterranean countries which was higher than the world average. The article suggests further studies in demographic and genetic factors should be examined to better understand patient outcomes per test frequency. \nOur research question similarly examines the relationship between testing frequency and patient outcomes (including fatality rates), but within Los Angeles and San Diego counties. We use a much smaller, specialized dataset that closely examines a different geographic and demographic region."

Since the Supreme court is not intended to be a partisan body (rather it is intended to curb partisan bodies based off of interpretations of the constitution), knowing which aspects of a Supreme court case affect the hypothetical “neutral” nature of the court might be important in determining future policy designed to keep the Supreme court relatively “unbiased.”\nThe factors we will be looking at as it relates to each partisan decision (which is a categorical variable coded as “decision.direction”) are as follows: whether or not this decision overruled a previous Supreme Court decision (categorical), whether or not this decision deemed a government action unconstitutional (categorical), year in which the decision is made (categorical), type of issue the case considers (categorical), head Supreme Court judge at the time (categorical), type of petitioner (categorical), and # of majority and minority votes (quantitative).\nWe hypothesize that the type of issue and the time period will be the two most salient factors regarding partisan outcome."

This analysis attempts to determine whether a correlation exists between the party alignment of circuit court panel judges and the Supreme Court’s rate of overturning circuit court decisions. The author utilizes data obtained by the Chicago Judges Project and alters it to ensure that the sample size only includes circuits in which judges are randomly assigned. The data analyzed is from the years 1995-2004 and covers cases from 16 different issue types. After analysis, the author finds that decisions by circuit courts with 3 Democrat judges were four times as likely to be chosen for review and overturned by the Supreme Court than decisions by circuit courts with 3 Republican judges. \nThis article is similar to the work we are doing, as it attempts to connect factors of a case to partisanship in order to highlight predictors of Supreme Court partisanship and the existence of the Supreme Court as a partisan body.
