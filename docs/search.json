    "text": "Introduction and data\n\nIdentify the source of the data: The data is from the competition records of the International Skating Union, Tallinn Trophy, and the Russian Skating Federation. The International Skating Union (ISU) is the governing body of figure skating competition around the world. ISU-sanctioned and many other competitions have websites containing records of the detailed results of the competition. (There is a separate site for each competition so for brevity’s sake sites will not be linked here.)\nState when and how it was originally collected: The ISU keeps records of the detailed score breakdowns, known as protocols, for each skater at each of its competitions. Each country’s skating federation also keeps these records for their domestic competitions, including national championships. Each competition has its own individual webpage, on which pdfs containing these protocols can be found. Everything is included, from jumps to spins to artistry scores. As the collector of the data file, I selected the competitions attended by Alexandra Trusova and pulled the data for each of her jumping passes into a .csv file. There are no ethical questions with this dataset due to its quantitative nature, drawing only from the judging protocols.\nWrite a brief description of the observations: There is an entry for each jumping pass attempted by Trusova in either ISU-sanctioned international competition, another international competition, or at a Russian National Championship. The data accompanying it include the data the jumping pass was attempted, the competition season it occurred, the location of the competition, and other data such as whether the jumping pass was a solo jump or a combination, any technical calls issued, and the grade of execution received.\nAll of this information is available publicly so there is no ethical/privacy concerns about the data.\nWe are in the process of adding more observations to the dataset, and there will be 303 once the process is complete."

    "text": "Research question\n\nFor this data set, our research question is as follows: How did Alexandra Trusova’s jumping passes evolve over time, and how do different factors affect her successful execution of difficult technical content?\nOur research question is important because it investigates many of the trends figure skating fans believe to exist with Russian figure skaters – namely, the “expiration date” that occurs once a skater reaches 16 or 17. It will also allow us to explore other trends that occur with an athlete that executed jumps never before done by female skaters and track Trusova’s progress over her entire career.\nDescription of the research topic: Alexandra Trusova is a notable Russian figure skater. She has spent 5 seasons competing internationally for Russia at various ISU-sanctioned competitions including the Grand Prix circuit, European championships, World championships, and even the Olympics. She has pushed the technical boundaries of the sport, and her development over the years is interesting to track. In her novice years, she struggled to land clean triple jumps. By her junior years, she was attempting quadruple jumps. By her senior years, she was attempting multiple quadruple jumps in each program, often in combination.\nIndividual skaters may have preferences for competition location, such as those close to home. They may also be better at jumps attempted in the first half of a competition as compared to the second half. Their success rate at a particular jumping pass may change over the seasons. It’s also possible that as a skater introduces a new jumping pass into their program, their success rate for other jumps will be affected. We hypothesize that there will be strong correlations between jump number and level and the successful outcome of a jumping pass.\nThere are both categorical and quantitative variables in this dataset. The variables which describe the competition and the basic jump info are categorical, and the variables describing the point value of the jump (jump_bv, goe_raw, goe_scaled, point_value, and other numerical values) are quantitative."

Landing for success: a biomechanical and perceptual analysis of on-ice jumps in figure skating. Sports Biomech. 2006 Jul;5(2):231-41. doi: 10.1080/14763140608522876. PMID: 16939155.\nThe study in the article investigated the biomechanical variables affecting the technical success of a jump. The researchers attached markers to anatomical points on the skater’s body, filmed the jump, and conducted analysis in two ways: objectively using biomechanical measures and subjectively by accredited figure skating judges. They found that the correlation between “biomechanical landing strategies” and judge perception is strong enough to support the continuation of the current subjective judging methods in figure skating.\nOur research is different than the article cited because it looks at other non-biomechanical factors affecting the outcome of a jump, such as altitude, location, time of year, segment of competition, and position in program. Additionally our data focuses on a single skater rather than multiple. Of course this means our findings cannot be extrapolated to other skaters, but it will find out what factors specifically influence Alexandra Trusova’s technical success in her programs."

To determine patient outcomes, we want to look at the number of weekly deaths, the number of hospital admissions, the percentage of staffed adult inpatient beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the percentage of staffed adult ICU beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients. We chose to look at Los Angeles and San Diego as they both have diverse populations (in terms of both ethnicity socioeconomic status), but of different sizes. We thus plan on observing trends both (1) across Los Angeles and San Diego and (2) within the respective counties and examining whether there are differences between the two. This question is important because the results can be used as evidence to advocate for (1) additional research to be done in how to improve COVID-19 tests and for (2) additional funding to make tests more widely available across both the United States and globally.\nOur hypothesis is that increased testing improves patient outcomes. We predict this because an early diagnosis should allow an individual to receive treatment (e.x. paxlovid) earlier and prevents the spreading of COVID to populations who are at high risk of mortality.\nThe variables we will look at include:\n\nWeekly Cases – Quantitative\nWeekly Deaths – Quantitative\nTests performed (7 day rolling average) – Quantitative\nNew Admissions Confirmed COVID-19 per 100000 Population Last 7 Days – Quantitative\nPercentage of staffed adult inpatient beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients over a trailing 7 day period – Quantitative\nPercentage of staffed adult ICU beds used by confirmed COVID-19 patients over a trailing 7 day period - Quantitative\nCounty – Categorical (Los Angeles County or San Diego County)"

The article finds that though testing frequency was similar to the rest of the world, average incidence and mortality rates per population were 70% and 90% lower, respectively. It also unexpectedly found that higher-testing Gulf Cooperation Council countries saw similar case-fatality rates as other Eastern Mediterranean countries which was higher than the world average. The article suggests further studies in demographic and genetic factors should be examined to better understand patient outcomes per test frequency. \nOur research question similarly examines the relationship between testing frequency and patient outcomes (including fatality rates), but within Los Angeles and San Diego counties. We use a much smaller, specialized dataset that closely examines a different geographic and demographic region."

This analysis attempts to determine whether a correlation exists between the party alignment of circuit court panel judges and the Supreme Court’s rate of overturning circuit court decisions.

The data analyzed is from the years 1995-2004 and covers cases from 16 different issue types. After analysis, the author finds that decisions by circuit courts with 3 Democrat judges were four times as likely to be chosen for review and overturned by the Supreme Court than decisions by circuit courts with 3 Republican judges. \nThis article is similar to the work we are doing, as it attempts to connect factors of a case to partisanship in order to highlight predictors of Supreme Court partisanship and the existence of the Supreme Court as a partisan body.

Due to how few female skaters have performed numerous types of quads over many years of their career, it was simply not possible to gather data for a large sample of skaters. As such, the conclusions we’ve drawn regarding Alexandra Trusova’s jumps and performance cannot be generalized to the sport of figure skating as a whole until it can be supported by data gathered from the careers of other skaters."
